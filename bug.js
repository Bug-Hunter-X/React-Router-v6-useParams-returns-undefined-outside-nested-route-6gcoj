In React Router Dom v6, a common issue arises when using the `useParams` hook inside a component that's not directly nested within a route.  If you try to access parameters before the component has mounted and the route has fully resolved, `useParams` will return an empty object, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

For example:

```javascript
import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';

function MyComponent() {
  const { id } = useParams();
  console.log(id); // Might be undefined initially
  return <div>My Component {id}</div>;
}

export default MyComponent;
```

If `MyComponent` isn't directly within a route, `id` might be `undefined` initially, causing errors or unexpected renders.
